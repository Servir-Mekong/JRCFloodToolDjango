       <h1>Historical Flood Analysis Tool</h1>
       <h4 class="text-justify">
          The historical flood analysis tool was build upon the Joint
          Research Centre (JRC) Global Surface Water dataset. The JRC dataset
          contains maps of the location and temporal distribution of surface
          water from 1984 to 2015 and provides statistics on the extent and
          change of those water surfaces. These data were generated using
          3,066,102 scenes from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 acquired between 16 March
          1984 and 10 October 2015. Each pixel was individually classified
          into water / non-water using an expert system and the results were
          collated into a monthly history for the entire time period The
          Monthly History collection holds the entire history of water
          detection on a month-by-month basis. The collection contains 380
          images, one for each month between March 1984 and October 2015. For
          more information see the associated journal article: High-resolution
          mapping of global surface water and its long-term changes

          The historical flood analysis tool presents the occurance of
          surface water for the selected period. A 100% water occurance means
          that all datapoints in the collection are identified of water
          (permanent water), 50% implies a location that is inundated half of
          the time. Locations with a low surface water occurance have only
          been inundated for a short period in the whole period, likely caused
          by flood events.
        <br /><br />
          It is important to note that not all historical floods are
          recorded in the dataseries. Floods might have occured between two
          overpasses of the satellites or observations might have been
          compromised by atmospheric conditions.
        <br /><br />
          The tool helps to identify areas prone to flooding using the
          complete Landsat archive. Areas which have been flooded in the past
          are also prone to floods in the future.
